I am a few months into my start as a web developer and it has been a challenging, satisfying, eye opening journey so far.  I didn't realize how satisfying it could feel to have every test pass until you spend a few hours stuck on one problem and finally get all of your methods, variables, and loops in order.  I have shrieked with joy on more than one ocassion when all of the Learn tests are green!

I have come to the programming world through a very roundabout career path.  I studied art history in college and have always valued creativity and understanding the history and background of a visual object.  For the past few years, I have been working in fundraising, both for an art museum and for a univeristy.  I love meeting new people and it is very rewarding to help find resources to support research, fund scholarships for students, and to support local artists in my city.  

One thing I have found missing is being the person doing the creating!  Through my career I have met some wonderfully talented artists, professors, and students who are conducting world-changing research and, while I do find it enjoyable to tell others about their work and to find resources to support it, I missed being the one *making* something.  So far, that has been the best thing about the web development course--I loved creating a tangible Tic Tac Toe game that I could show to my friends and family even though it may seem trivial.  It gives me hope that I can use programming to fulfill that need to create and perhaps lend these skills back to my love of art or the nonprofit world.  In a way, I think that coding is a type of art and I am looking forward to learning as much as I can about how to make it!
