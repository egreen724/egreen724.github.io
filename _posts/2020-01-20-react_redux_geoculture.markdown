The final React/Redux project has been the most challenging of the Flatiron curriculum.  Just as I was starting to get comfortable with React and "stateful" components, Redux and all of its terminology through off my understanding.  I also struggled getting used to the idea of a single page web app since I had grown comfortable with Rails and the RESTful structure of website.  

I decided to push through to the portfolio project hoping that things would click as I put them into practice through my app idea.  While this did happen to a certain extent, I hit a wall after I set up the basic infrastructure of my app.   I felt like I didn't have a good sense of which components needed to connect to the Redux store or how to plan out my actions and reducers.  I decided to take a step back from writing useless and frustrating code and to go back to the basics. 

I spent a day or two watching video walkthroughs in the Learn Video Lectures section (specifically the Globetrotter videos and the Redux fundamentals videos) and this was monumentally helpful.  Watching the instructors talk through a project from the planning phase to implementation gave me a 10,000 foot view of a React/Redux app and helped me to understand the bigger concepts as well as how to implement them in my app.  It helped me know what questions to ask and allowed me to plan things out instead of just relying on trial and error.

The app I ended up making is called GeoCulture and allows users search a database of artwork (seeded through Artsy.com and their public API) to plan travel and to see all works of art in a specific city.  User's can save artwork to a list of favorites to plan what museums or institutions they want to visit on a trip.   This app idea was inspired by a recent trip to Germany when I spent an afternoon searching through the websites of 5-10 different museums to see what works they had in their collections.  While it is currently only possible to filter the artwork by city, eventually I would like to add features to filter or search by artist. 

GeoCulture is currently at the minimum viable product phase and I feel much more comfortable applying React/Redux with a Rails API backend.  In the future, I plan to add user authentication and to continue refactoring my code to apply best practices in React/Redux.
