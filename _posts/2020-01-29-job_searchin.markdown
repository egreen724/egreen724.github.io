As I prepare to complete the Flatiron curriculum, I have started putting some feelers out on the job market (both in my local city and online for remote positions).  I have found a few online resources that I thought might be useful for other students. 

1. https://www.jrdevjobs.com/ 

This job board is specifically for junior developer positions and is targeted to bootcamp graduates.  I have already found a few posted in my area and it seems to be updated regularly! 

2. https://www.techjobsforgood.com/

Coming from the nonprofit world, my dream job would be to work for a software engineering team within a company or nonprofit that is doing something for the greater good.  I didn't think that would be as common as it is but I was thrilled to find Tech Jobs for Good! There are also a lot of great resources through http://www.techforgood.global/ such as articles and podcasts. 

3. Local Slack Channels

Atlanta has a local slack channel for the tech community called tech404 that has a jobs channel I have been following.  It seems to be a great way to talk to people who work in companies around town and to chat with them directly when they share job opportunities.

I also signed up for this newsletter which sends out a weekly roundup of companies that hire remote software engineers.  I have found some great companies through this and would highly recommend it!
