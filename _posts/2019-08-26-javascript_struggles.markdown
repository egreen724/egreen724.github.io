> How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it.


When working through the JS + Rails portfolio project,  I found myself really struggling with wanting to apply my Ruby knowledge to the Javascript methods I was writing.  In general, I understand the benefits of JS and the differences between the languages, but I still miss the underlying philosophy of Ruby being "designed to make programmers happy."

I found Javascript to be convaluted and confusing, and overall just not making me happy.  In some cases, I would know the exact logic that I needed to apply (and how to express it in Ruby) and it would take me 3 times as long to find the right syntax needed to solve the problem.

I am wrapping up my portfolio project and while I have plodded through satisfying all of the requirements, I'm still not leaving this section feeling confident in my JS skills.  As prevalent as JS is in web development, it's an intimidating feeling to not be catching on as quickly.  I find myself wondering if this is a common struggle when you learn a new programming language or if I am just not very good at Javascript yet (or both!). 

I found another blog post about choosing the "right programming language" and the last line really hit home:

> Before you pick a language, learn to speak.

Time to focus on the basics and push ahead getting comfortable with Javascript and all of its possibilities!
