The Sinatra section of the Learn curriculum has by far been the most challenging, but also the section with the most "light bulb" moments.  It is amazing to see how all of the pieces that we have been learning are fitting together and the MVC structure is really starting to click for me.

Before starting the project, I polled some friends to get an idea of things they would use a simple web page to keep track of.  After a few conversations, it occurred to me that I constantly have conversations with people about the shows they are watching on Netflix (or other streaming services) and the podcasts they are listening to, but there isn't a great social platform for friends to share this information (similar to GoodReads).  I hope to keep expanding on this idea, but I started with a simple Sinatra app called "ListenUp" that displays a feed of users and the podcasts they are listening to. Users can login to add, edit, and delete their own podcasts or copy podcasts from other users' lists.  Users can also include a description to explain the podcast and why they enjoy it.

This was a fairly straightforward CRUD app but it was a great exercise to put it together from start to finish! I may continue tweaking it to add a genre, tv show, or movie model in the future. I also challenged myself to play with some CSS and found out that I still have a lot to learn! It currently resembles a really bad Windows 95 program but I'm continuing to tweak it as a schedule my review. 

Best of luck everyone! Check out ListenUp at: https://github.com/egreen724/podcast_tracker_SinatraProject
